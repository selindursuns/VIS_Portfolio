        <h3>Question 1: How have socio-economic factors influenced the annual trajectory of median housing prices in Boston, and what does this indicate about the city's evolving housing affordability and demographic shifts? </h3>

        <p>The graph shows the trend of median housing prices from 2000 onwards, which provides insight into how the housing market has evolved over the years. The color gradient that changes along the line could represent different phases or periods within the data, such as before and after a significant market event (like the financial crisis of 2008) or a change in policy that affected housing prices.</p>


        <h3>Question 2: What are the spatial dynamics of property flipping in Boston, and how do they reflect underlying economic and regulatory factors influencing real estate investment patterns across different neighborhoods? </h3>


        <p>This map elucidates the concentration of property flipping activities within Boston's diverse zip codes, serving as a lens to understand real estate investment behaviors. The varying shades across the neighborhoods highlight the intensity of flipping transactions, potentially indicating areas of rapid growth or transition. Zip codes with darker hues may signify hotspots for investment and could be areas undergoing gentrification or attracting speculative interest due to various factors such as proximity to upcoming infrastructure projects, commercial developments, or changes in urban policy. Conversely, areas with lighter shades may represent more stable neighborhoods with less transient real estate activity. This spatial distribution invites further investigation into the socioeconomic catalysts driving these patterns, such as disparities in income levels, access to credit, or targeted urban development initiatives. By dissecting these patterns, stakeholders, including policymakers, investors, and community advocates, can gain a nuanced understanding of the market forces at play and consider appropriate responses to ensure sustainable and equitable urban growth.</p>
